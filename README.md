# Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto-Quadrature
A Modern-Fortran module that calculates the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto Quadrature as well as a useful set of functions for the Jacobi polynomials

Algorithms for computing these nodes and weights efficiently can be found in [here](https://github.com/nickhale/quadpts).

The work from which this fortran implementation is inspired can be found in [here](https://doi.org/10.1137/120889873).
